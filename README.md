# `esp8266-examples`: Anton's ESP8266 example code

I'll try and use this repo as a way to come up with ideas for interesting small projects
based on the ESP8266, and then figure out how to implement code to demonstrate those
project ideas.

For now, I expect these will be exclusively done in C, using the ESP8266 NONOS SDK.

I'll grow this documentation as time permits :)
